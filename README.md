## Changes That I made
- Stuff that I created:
    - Typing animation for the intruction:
        - Reason: I think it is a fun little animation for the website so that it doesn't look plain.
    - Downloadable Resume:
        - Created a downloadable resume for employers to access it directly, so it is easier for them to
        review the resume directly.

- Stuff I modiied:
    - Removed home page and made *about me* page as index
        - Since there isn't anything to put on the home page, I think *about me* page is a prefect landing page for viewers to see.
    
    - Removed dark/light switch
        - I don't think it is necessary for a portfolio.

- Cleaned up code for readability.
